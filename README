-------------------- 
The Persistence Layer of the eco4r overlay journal consists of 2 tiers, an RDF Triplestore and a Relational Database. 
The triples in the OAI-ORE Resource Maps that have been harvested beforehand are Stored in the  Sesame Triplestore. 
For the overlay journal, Sesame is the main persistence unity. 
However, to augment the performance of fetching information from the overlay journal a kind of caching system on top of Sesame is required. 
For this purpose we decided to include a MySQL database that holds a summary of the information stored in Sesame.

THIS PIECE OF SOFTWARE IS IN BETA STAGE
